### Asset Changes

1. **Placeholder Images**
   - Added category-specific placeholder images:

   - Created using existing placeholder as a base

2. **Documentation**
   - Added `CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md` guide for configuring Cloudinary
   - Added troubleshooting steps for image display issues

## How to Test

1. Configure Cloudinary by setting the required environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

2. Run the Cloudinary test script:
   ```
   node utils/test-cloudinary.js
   ```

3. Restart the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Try uploading a new product with images and verify that they display correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If images still don't display correctly:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Look at the server logs for image-related issues
3. Verify that your Cloudinary credentials are correct
4. Ensure that the frontend can access the Cloudinary URLs 
   (check for CORS issues or network restrictions)

In the meantime, the system will use local placeholder images based on product category.
